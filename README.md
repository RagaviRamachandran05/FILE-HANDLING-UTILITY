# TASK DESCRIPTION

A File Handling Utility is a software component or tool that allows programs or users to manage and manipulate files on a computer system. This includes performing basic file operations such as creating, reading, writing, editing, renaming, copying, moving, and deleting files. In programming, especially in Java, Python, or C++, file handling utilities form a critical part of input/output (I/O) operations.

Key Features of a File Handling Utility:
File Creation
The utility can create new files or directories if they donâ€™t already exist. For example, in Java, the File.createNewFile() method is used to create a file.

Reading Files
Reading involves accessing and retrieving the content stored in a file. Depending on the language, this can be line-by-line or full-content reading. Java uses BufferedReader, Scanner, or FileReader.

Writing/Updating Files
Writing involves saving or updating content in a file. This includes appending new data or overwriting existing content. In Java, classes like FileWriter, BufferedWriter, or PrintWriter are commonly used.

File Deletion and Renaming
The utility can rename or delete files when they are no longer needed. In Java, File.renameTo() and File.delete() methods provide this functionality.

File Searching and Filtering
Advanced file handling utilities include search functionality to find files by name, type, or content. Filters can help operate only on specific file formats (e.g., .txt, .pdf).

Exception Handling
File handling typically involves exceptions like FileNotFoundException, IOException, etc. A robust utility handles these gracefully to prevent application crashes.

Use Cases
Text Editors use file handling to open and save user files.

Backup Systems copy and move files between directories or drives.

Log Management utilities generate and store logs for system diagnostics.

Data Processing tools read from CSV, JSON, or XML files.
